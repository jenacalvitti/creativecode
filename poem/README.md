# Tape2

This poem, "Tape 2", was created from one of my favorite books, "13 Reasons Why". I wanted this poem to have deep meaning behind friendship and take the feelings from the narrator and project them on to the reader. This was not my original idea for the poem. My original idea was to take the movie, "Someone Great", unfortunately there were so many curse words and innapropriate situations, if I were to filter it out, it would have changed the integrity of the movie and poem I wanted to create. Once I changed sources for my poem, it became much easier to read and understand, and I was able to create a story within the poem.

Within this code, it will filter through the sentences, and find the ones with however many words you ask for. Then, it will output the sentences with the amount of words you ask. 

Here is the link to my python notebook where the code is hosted: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y-PCOsS-gFUlo41TtWKyLbeJG-rJzvFI
