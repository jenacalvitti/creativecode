# HBPoem3

For my poem, I took one of Hannah Baker's poems (poem 3) and remixed it to rhyme. Hannah Baker is the main character in the book, and this specific poem talks about suicide and how she is so depressed when everyone else is so happy. Playing off my idea from the previous version, I thought it would be interesting to take one of her poems, and make it my own. 

Below is the poem that my code produces. 

["You can't see what's going on", "Because what's going on is too deep christianne", 'too dark for you to see', "Everyone's smiling and talking, and hohensee", "and i'm thinking", "How the fuck are so you so happy when I'm screaming rethinking", "I want to leave, but I can't", "I'm bound by the will I can never give plante", 'Why am I stopping?']

This poem is all in one line, because I thought it made more sense this way. Below is the original poem. 

You can't see what's going on
Because what's going on is too deep and
too dark for you to see
Everyone's smiling and talking, and happy
and i'm thinking
How the fuck are so you so happy when I'm screaming inside!
I want to leave, but I can't
I'm bound by the will I can never give up
Why am I stopping?
I want to leave but I can't
I'm bound by the will I can never give up
You do what you have to,
to try and survive
I may be ugly, but at least I'm alive
