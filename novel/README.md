# I Love My Dog

For this project, I was inspired by the "Bison, Bison, Bison" novel, but wanted to do something a little different. I was inspired by my dog, Duncan. Having a dog in college, sometimes you really love your dog, sometimes you only sometimes love your dog, and othertimes, you love your dog despite how frustrating they can be. This project was pretty simple for me to figure out, importing my ideas to the code we worked on in class.
