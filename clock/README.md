# Coffee O'Clock

This is an abstract clock I made with p5.js. The easiest way to see it in action is to copy the contents of [the javascript file](concentric-clock.js)  into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org) and run it.

To read the clock's time, you have to read the pie chart and look at the number that it says under each coffee mug. Looking left to right, the far left is hours, the middle is minutes, and the left is seconds. 

I like the abstract of this clock because I like the idea that it is always a good time for coffee. This doesn't go with my original ideak, but it still involves coffee. I would say that it is pretty easy to read if you understand military time.
